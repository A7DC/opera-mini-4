# Opera mini 4 testing for emulators 

Testing out how feature phones scale and render 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development. 
### Prerequisites


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

This will enable you to run a copy of the code in an emulator by opening up your port

```
$ git clone git@github.com:A7DC/opera-mini-4.git
$ cd opera-mini-4
$ npm i // downloads dependencies 
$ yarn start // star development server 
$ lt --port portnumber // use the port number that yarn gives you, mine is 8080 but yours might be different
```

Once you've completed the steps, terminal will output a web address such as `https://tender-chicken-5.localtunnel.me`. Enter this address into your emulator and you will be able to view the local code.

### Changes 

If you want to make changes, just make a branch and then create a PR.
